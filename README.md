# Learning Repo

This repo is part of my personal learning "voyage" ‚úåÔ∏è

I've been diving deeper into Cloud Native technologies, Open Source tools, and DevOps practices; putting some love into my homelab while trying to fill the gaps and explore the cool stuff out there.

This repository will grow to include different sub-projects focused on specific areas like:

- ‚òÅÔ∏è Public and Private Cloud
- üß© Kubernetes in all its flavors (K8s, K3s, Managed...)
- üìà Observability (mostly within cloud-native, of course)
- üîß Misc tooling, GitOps experiments, and automation scripts
- üå± Sustainability in tech
- ü§ñ Maybe even AI (there's no way around it)
- üåÄ And a ton of cloud-native related stuff

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository *will* contain mistakes, incorrect assumptions, and plenty of trial-and-error but that's the point.

I'm now embracing the idea of **learning in public**: putting things out there, iterating, and improving with the help of the community.  
I've benefited from this in the past, learned a lot from others, and maybe someone could benefit from this as well.

If you spot something off, feel free to open an issue or leave a comment. I genuinely appreciate it üôÇ (for real!!)

**PS:** I went for *voyage* instead of *journey* because *journey* sounded too much like AI. *Voyage* could be super AI (I know) but it's exotic, at least.
